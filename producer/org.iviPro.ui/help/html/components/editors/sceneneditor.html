<h1>Sceneeditor</h1>
<p align="justify">
<br>

With help of the <b>sceneneditor</b> you can create scenes out of a video to use them in your project.
Each video has to be converted into a scene before it can be used.<br><br>

If you don't want to use the entire video but just one or several parts of your video in the project, click onto the video in the 
media repository and choose "<b>Define scenes</b>" to open the editor. <br>
<img alt="open sceneeditor" src="sceneeditor/images/sceneeditor-how-to-open.jpg" width="80%"> <br><br>

If you want to use the entire video in your project, choose <b>"Create scene over complete video"</b>. 
The entire video will be converted into a scene and will appear from now in your scene-repository.<br>
<img alt="Create scene over complete video" src="sceneeditor/images/sceneeditor-entire-video-as-scene.jpg" width="30%"> <br><br>

If you have chosen "<b>Define scenes</b>" the video opens in the sceneeditor and can be edited.<br><br>

The sceneeditor consists of two windows - the one <a href="#unteresFenster">below</a> and the one on the  
<a href="#oberesFenster">upper</a> part.<br><br>

In the <a name="oberesFenster"><b>upper</b></a> window you can see the entire video:<br>

<img alt="entire video in the sceneeditor" src="sceneeditor/images/sceneeditor-entire-video-window.jpg" width="70%"> <br><br>

Here you can play the video and there are several functions you can make use of:<br>

<img alt="Functions" src="sceneeditor/images/sceneeditor-entire-video-functions.jpg" width="30%"> <br><br>

<ul>
  	<li><img alt="winding back" src="sceneeditor/images/sceneeditor-entire-video-one-second-back.jpg">
		winds back one second </li>
	<li><img alt="winding back one frame" src="sceneeditor/images/sceneeditor-entire-video-one-frame-back.jpg">
  		winds back one frame</li>
  	<li><img alt="start or pause video" src="sceneeditor/images/sceneeditor-entire-video-play-pause.jpg">
 		start or pause video</li>
 	<li><img alt="stop video" src="sceneeditor/images/sceneeditor-entire-video-stop.jpg">
  		stop video</li>
  	<li><img alt="fast forward one frame" src="sceneeditor/images/sceneeditor-entire-video-one-frame-forward.jpg">
  		fasts forward one frame </li>
  	<li><img alt="fast forward one second" src="sceneeditor/images/sceneeditor-entire-video-one-second-forward.jpg">
  		fasts forward one second</li>
  	<li><img alt="sound on/off" src="sceneeditor/images/sceneeditor-entire-video-sound-on-off.jpg">
  		sound on/off</li>
  	<li><img alt="change volume" src="sceneeditor/images/sceneeditor-entire-video-volume.jpg">
  		change volume</li>
</ul> <br>

Moreover you can find an overview of the already defined scenes here. There are two different possibilities to display them:
The first one is a detailed view where you can see how long a scene lasts and you get detailed information about the different 
scenes (e.g. starting point, a screenshot of the first image of the scene,...). The second possible view saves space and just 
the duration and the name of the scenes are shown.<br><br>

To create a <b>new scene</b> of the video that is open in the sceneeditor, click onto
<img alt="add scene" src="sceneeditor/images/sceneeditor-entire-video-order-add-new-scene.jpg">.
Now a new tab where you can create a new scene opens in the window below.<br><br>

The <b>number</b> as well as an <b>overview</b> of the created scenes of the video will be displayed here:<br>
<img alt="number of scenes" src="sceneeditor/images/sceneeditor-entire-video-amount-of-scenes.jpg" width="60%"> <br><br>

The scenes you have created can be displayed in different a <b>order</b>. If you open the drop down menu you can choose by clicking 
with the mouse according to which criteria the scenes should be sorted. Here you have four possibilities: sorting according to the 
name, starting point, ending point or duration of the scene.<br>
<img alt="order of scenes" src="sceneeditor/images/sceneeditor-entire-video-order-of-scenes-drop-down.jpg" 
width="60%"> <br><br>   

Furthermore you can choose whether you want the scenes in the overview-window to be sorted in ascending or descending order.<br>
<img alt="Anordnung der Szenen" src="sceneeditor/images/sceneeditor-entire-video-order-up-and-down.jpg" width="20%"> <br><br>

In the <a name="unteresFenster"><b>window below</b></a> you can cut different parts of the video into scenes and save them.<br>
<img alt="edit scene" src="sceneeditor/images/sceneeditor-edit-scene-window.jpg" width="60%"> <br><br> 

The points in time when the scene should <b>start</b> and <b>end</b> can be defined in various manners:<br>
<img alt="Starting- and Ending point" src="sceneeditor/images/sceneeditor-create-a-scene-start-and-end-edit.jpg" width="60%"><br><br>

<ol>
	<li>One option is to insert them directly into the input field.</li>
	<li>You can also set the starting point by left-clicking and the ending point by right-clicking with the mouse in the timeline.</li> 
	<li>Moreover you can move the yellow marker (starting point) and the red one (ending point) by maintaining the left mousebutton 
	pressed.</li>
	<li>Furhtermore you can put the grey marker there where you want the scene to start and end in the upper window. With the help of 
	the buttons "start" and "end" you can define them.</li>
</ol><br><br>

In the field <b>"Name of the scene"</b> you can name your scene.<br>
<img alt="Name of the scene" src="sceneeditor/images/sceneeditor-name.jpg" width="20%"> <br><br>

In the field <b>"keywords"</b> you can insert words, that give further explanations to the scene, which simplifies the searching 
process afterwards. The terms should be separated by commas.<br>
<img alt="keywords" src="sceneeditor/images/sceneeditor-key-words.jpg" width="20%"> <br><br>

By clicking onto the image in the lower window of the sceneeditor you can choose an image that you want to use as a 
<b>thumbnail</b> for your scene. 
This thumbnail is firmly related with the scene. For every item in the media-repository there is just one thumbnail.
<br>
<img alt="thumbnail" src="sceneeditor/images/sceneeditor-select-preview-image.jpg" width="50%"> <br><br>

A window opens, where you have the same functions as in the upper window of editing scenes. 
The picture that is placed where the grey mark is positioned will appear in the preview. If you have decided yourself for a 
thumbnail for your scene, click onto 
<b>"Select current image"</b>.<br>
<img alt="select thumbnail" src="sceneeditor/images/sceneeditor-preview-image-select.jpg" width="50%"> <br><br>

When your scene is ready, click onto <b>"Save annotation"</b>. If you want to create further scenes out of the same video so click onto 
<b>"Save annotation and create new one"</b>.<br>
<img alt="select thumbnail" src="sceneeditor/images/sceneeditor-save-scene.jpg" width="50%"> <br><br>

From now on you find the scene in your <b>Scene-Repository</b> and can be used for your project.<br>
<img alt="Scene-Repository" src="sceneeditor/images/sceneeditor-scene-in-scenerepository.jpg" width="50%"> <br><br>
