The SIVA Producer provides several views. Views are used to list and present different elements. A view can be used to open editors, or load and delete files.
<br><br>
The views in the SIVA Producer are:
<ul>
  <li>a media repository</li>
  <li>a scene repository</li>
  <li>an information area</li>
   <li>a detail view</li>
</ul>
<br>
The media repository is organized like a folder structure. The main folders are "Audio", "Text", "Images", and "Videos" where the loaded files are filed into. The media repository can be used to rename the imported files for a better overview without changing their names in the file system.

The scene repository is arranged in a folder structure as well. The main folders are "Scenes used in the Graph" and "Scenes not used in the Graph". Scenes which are not used in the scene graph can be found in the "Scenes not used in the Graph" category. If a scene is used in the scene graph at least once, the scene is filed into the "Scenes used in the Graph" category:
