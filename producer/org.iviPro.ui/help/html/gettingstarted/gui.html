The GUI of the SIVA Producer consists of a menu bar, different views and editors.
<br><br>

Items in the menu bar which can't be used in the current state of the program are deactivated. Views show objects and information about the objects. The objects can be edited in the editors. It is possible to organize editors and views freely. Therefore, the tab is moved to the desired position with a pressed mouse button. The appearing arrow shows where the editor/view will be docked.
