<h1>Adding a Scene to the Scene Graph</h1>
<p align="justify">
To add a scene to the scene graph, it has to be dragged and dropped from the scene repository to the desired position in the scene graph. To integrate the scene into the scene graph, it has to be linked with edges into the temporal sequence of the interactive video. To add an edge, the edge tool has to be selected from the tool area. After that, first the start and then the end node/scene of the edge has to be clicked.
