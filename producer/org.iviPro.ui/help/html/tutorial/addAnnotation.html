<h1>Adding scene annotations</h1>
<p align="justify">

The scene graph of your first interactive video with SIVA is now ready. Now you can add annotations to the scenes.<br>

<p>
The following types of media can be used and chosen:
<ul>
	<li>video</li>
	<li>audio</li>
	<li>picture</li>
	<li>text</li>
	<li>subtitle</li>
	<li>PDF</li>
</ul>
</p>

For that purpose you have already loaded a picture into the media repository. This picture will be added as an annotation to a scene.
Now move the picture via drag an drop into the scene it should be added to. A small red star appears in the scene 
symbol. It shows that an annotation already has been added to this scene. In the picture below this was marked by a green 
frame.<br><br>
<img src="images/AnnotationHinzufuegenDragDrop.png" alt="Annotation hinzufügen" width=1000"> <br><br>

To edit an annotation click onto the button with the pen and the annotation editor will be opened.<br>

<p>
An annotation always consists of content, duration and a name. According to the type of the annotation the content can be changed. 
The annotation can be given a <b>name</b> by the user. If no name is choses, this will be done by SIVA. For every annotation a 
starting and an ending point have to be set. This can be done in different ways:<br>
<ul>
	<li>entering the starting and ending point into the input fields</li>
	<li>shifting the starting and ending point on the timeline</li>
	<li>setting by clicking onto the timeline: the cursor is positioned on a required point on the timeline and the left mouse 
	button is clicked. The defining of the ending point is done in the same manner, but the right mouse button has to be clicked.</li>
</ul><br>

If all settings are done, the annotation should be saved by clicking the "<b>Save</b>"-button. Then the annotation now appears in the timeline 
section in the window above. 
</p><br>

Now the scene graph is ready. In the next section the saving and exporting of the interactive video is shown.
Therefore click onto the next menu item "<b>Saving and exporting a video project</b>" in the help index on the left side 
or click onto the following link:
