<h1>Adding media files</h1>
<p align="justify">

After having created the project you can load media that from then on will appear in the media repository.
Click onto the "<b>Load Media</b>"-button in the taskbar ("+"-button). The open-window is opened where you can choose a file 
you want to load.
<br>

<p align="justify">

<p>
You can choose from the following types of media:
<ul>
	<li>video</li>
	<li>audio</li>
	<li>picture</li>
	<li>pdf</li>
	<li>text</li>
</ul>
</p>

Please load two video files and one picture file for this tutorial.<br>
Now your media repository should look like in the picture below.

<p align="justify">
<p>
Next you have to convert the videos into scenes or you cut them to integrate them into the scene graph, so that they can be used 
in your interactive video.
</p>

You can do this in two different ways by right clicking on the video and after that choose one of the following options:
<ul>
	<li>You want that the entire video is a scene in your interactive video: <b>create scene over the full length of the video</b>.</li>
	<li>You want that only a part of the video is a scene in your interactive video: <b>edit scene</b>.</li>
</ul>
If you prefer the first option, the entire video will appear as a scene in you scene repository.<br>
If you choose the second option, how to cut a video is explained in the next menu item.<br> 
Important for this tutorial is that you add three scenes to the scene repository.<br><br>

For editing the scenes please click onto the next menu item "<b>Cutting videos</b>" in the help index on the left side or on 
the following link:
