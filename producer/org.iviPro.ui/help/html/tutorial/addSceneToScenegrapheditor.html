<h1>Composing a scene graph</h1>
<p align="justify">

Now you splitted the videos in scenes, now it is time to insert them in the scene graph editor.

<p>
<div style="border&#58; solid 2px #ff0000;">
Notice: The start node has to be followed by a scene! You may not add here an option of the 'tools'-section.
</div>
</p>

<p>
<div style="border&#58; solid 2px #ff0000;">
Notice: The user selection have to be linked with the options, before it can be linked with a scene.
</div>
</p>

Now add a scene via drag and drop (described in the picture per the red arrow) to the scene graph editor (click the scene, hold mouse button, drag the scene to the scene graph editor, drop the mouse button).

After that you can link the start node with the scene with an arrow by choosing a connection tool from the tool section and then you click on the start node and after that on the scene (see the green mark).

Next we will finish the scene graph with the scenes. Thereto you drag the two left scenes per drag and drop to the scene graph editor. After that you drag the user selection (green mark) and two options (blue mark) in the editor. Afterwards link the first scene with the user selection and the user selection with the two options. Link the first option with the third scene and the second option with the fourth one. Now link the third scene with the start scene and the fourth scene with the end node. For comparison, consider the picture below.
