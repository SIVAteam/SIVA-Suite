<h1>Composing a scene graph</h1>
<p align="justify">

Now you cut the videos into scenes, now it is time to insert them in the scene graph editor.

<p>
<div style="border&#58; solid 2px #ff0000;">
Notice: The start node has to be followed by a scene! You must not add an option of the 'tools'-section here.
</div>
</p>

<p>
<div style="border&#58; solid 2px #ff0000;">
Notice: The user selection has to be linked with the options, before it can be linked with a scene.
</div>
</p>

Now add a scene via drag and drop (described in the picture with the red arrow) to the scene graph editor (click onto the scene, 
hold the mouse button, drag the scene to the scene graph editor, drop the mouse button).

After that you can link the start node with the scene with an arrow by choosing a connection tool from the tool section and then 
you click on the start node and after that on the scene (see the green mark).<br>

<p>
Next we will finish the scene graph with the scenes. Therefore you drag the two left scenes per drag and drop into the scene graph 
editor. After that you drag the user selection (green) and two options (blue) into the editor. Now link the first 
scene with the user selection and the user selection with the two options. Link the first option with the third scene and the 
second option with the fourth one. Finally link the third scene with the start scene and the fourth scene with the end node. For 
comparison have a look at the picture below.

Now the scene graph is created. In the next section we will show you how to add annotations to a scene.
