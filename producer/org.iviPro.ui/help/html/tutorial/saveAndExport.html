	<li>If you want to <b>save</b> the video, click onto the save-button.<br> 
		It has a green border on the picture. Saving a project means, that all information is saved, so that you can open or edit 
		it again in the SIVA-producer.</li>
	<li>If you want to <b>export</b> the video, click on the export-button.<br> 
		It has a red border in the picture. Exporting a project means, that all information is saved in a file, so that you can 
		watch the video in a media player.</li>
</ul><br>

		<li>During the following steps you can deselect further settings for the audio- and video-settings.</li>
		<li>After that click onto "<b>Finish</b>" to create your new profile.</li>
	</ol>
	<li>Now you can choose which of the appearing profiles should be used for your export by selecting them in the "Export"-column 
		with a check mark.</li>
	<li>As a last step you choose the file where your exported project should be saved in, at "<b>Output folder</b>" and finish 
		the export with a click onto "<b>Finish</b>". Now the project will be exported.</li>
		<img alt="finish export" src="../../images/safe-and-export-export-finish.jpg" width="40%"><br>
	<li>After the export finished, for each selected export profile you should see a subfolder inside the chosen "<b>Output folder</b>". 
	Watching a video is as simple as opening the "<b>index.html</b>" found inside these subfolders in your favorite browser.
